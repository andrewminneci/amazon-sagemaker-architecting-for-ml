Team: Cortney Roberts, Andrew Minneci, Megan Hainstock

Business Objective
Recommend products to consumers based on their previous purchases. 

Datasets
Santander Financial Data from Kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/c/santander-product-recommendation/data
Data includes demographic, customer information, consumer product purchases. 
Training dataset - 1.5 years of consumer behavior beginning January 2015.

Model Strategy
Multi-class recommender 

Using subject matter expertise products will be categorized into 5(ish) product lines. 
Dataset will be created so that observations represent purchases and each observation will show the product line purchased. For repeat customers, the prior purchase will also be identified. 

End Goal 
At least one recommended product line for all active consumers.
